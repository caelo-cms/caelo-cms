/**
 * v0.6.0 W5 — Owner queue for AI tool calls gated by the
 * `needsApproval` predicate on `ToolDefinitionWithHandler`. The
 * dispatcher writes a row to `tool_approval_actions` whenever a
 * gated tool fires; this route surfaces those rows + lets the Owner
 * approve/reject. Approve runs the persisted tool with the persisted
 * args via the same ToolRegistry the chat-runner uses.
 *
 * Mirrors the shape of /security/snapshots/pending +page.server.ts —
 * the approve flow swaps the per-domain `*.execute_proposal` op for
 * a two-step claim-then-dispatch:
 *   1. `tool_approvals.read_for_execute` — atomic pending → applied
 *      transition + returns the persisted args.
 *   2. ToolRegistry.dispatch — runs the tool's handler with the
 *      operator's session ctx (NOT the AI ctx that originally
 *      proposed) so the audit log credits the human approver.
 *   3. `tool_approvals.mark_result` — captures the dispatch outcome
 *      so the queue page shows "applied — succeeded" / "applied —
 *      failed: <reason>".
 *
 * DESIGN CONTRACTS:
 *
 * (a) Live-commit semantics. The dispatch carries `chatSessionId` (so
 *     the audit log links the action back to the chat origin) but
 *     deliberately OMITS `chatBranchId`. Once the Owner approves, the
 *     action commits directly to main — it does NOT branch-write into
 *     the proposing chat. Rationale: gated tools are by definition
 *     hard-to-revert; making them branch-only would mean an Approve
 *     click is a no-op on main until the chat publishes, which is
 *     surprising for destructive ops. If you ship a future gated tool
 *     where branch-write IS the desired semantic, store branchId in
 *     the persisted row and read it here.
 *
 * (b) Built-in tools only. The dispatch uses
 *     `createDefaultToolRegistry()` which is the BUILT-IN catalogue
 *     only — Tier-1 plugin tools registered through
 *     `pluginToolsRegistry` are NOT included. Plugin tools with
 *     `needsApproval` would queue fine but Approve would 400 with
 *     "unknown tool". Lift this constraint by importing
 *     `pluginToolsRegistry` here and folding its entries into the
 *     dispatcher's lookup, mirroring the chat-runner's catalogue
 *     assembly at chat-runner.ts:966.
 *
 * (c) Owner-ctx dispatch + actor-scope mismatch (v0.6.0 alpha.4 Fix R).
 *     The dispatched tool runs with `locals.ctx` (actorKind: "human")
 *     so the audit log credits the Owner who approved. But the
 *     ORIGINAL propose-time dispatch ran with the AI's ctx
 *     (actorKind: "ai"). Tools whose actorScope EXCLUDES "human"
 *     (e.g., the rare `["ai", "system"]` shape) would queue at
 *     propose-time but fail at approve-time with `ActorScopeRejected`.
 *     Every currently-shipped tool with `needsApproval`
 *     (delete_pages_many) has `["human", "ai", "system"]` scope so
 *     this is not a live bug — but a future ai-only gated tool would
 *     need either: (i) the tool widens its actorScope to include
 *     human, OR (ii) the route here passes through the proposer's
 *     ctx with an Owner attribution layered on top.
