 * Real-AI end-to-end suite (issue #47).
 *
 * Drives the editor chat against the live Anthropic API (Sonnet 4.6,
 * temperature=0) to catch the regression classes the mock-AI suite at
 * `e2e/` cannot — empty AI turns, orphan locks after Stage, missing
 * tool primers — and verifies the published result with one closing
 * LLM-vision verdict.
 *
 * Differs from the mock-AI config in two structural ways:
 *
 *   - **No `webServer` block.** `global-setup.ts` spawns the admin
 *     (`bun run build/index.js`) itself and pipes stdio into
 *     `test-results/livedit/admin.log` so `assertNoChatRunnerDiagWarnings`
 *     can grep the captured stderr after a turn finishes. Playwright's
 *     own `webServer` child stdio is not reachable from spec code.
 *
 *   - **Retries = 2** (vs 0 in the smoke suite). Real-AI calls have
 *     irreducible variance even at temperature=0; two retries keep the
 *     PR check meaningful while structural assertions defend against
 *     content drift.
